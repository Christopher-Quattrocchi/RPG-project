Classes and constructor for Knight character (or whatever) containing type of character, HP, damage (to be added to math.random), and available actions (we can start with just attack).

Class w constructor for monster, with HP and attack damage

Class w constructor for game state, to monitor where the player is (not relevant for the first fight, but if they defeat the thing maybe they can fight another and this would track that)

Death screen if HP falls to 0, victory if monster hp falls to 0

function to allow player to attack, function to allow computer to fight back. Trade turns by flipping booleans, use promise, await and async functions to allow computer to fight.

More advanced - additional player classes and monsters. EXP tracked in player object. Multiple actions (say magic or inventory). If player levels up (in this case that means defeating one monster), add to their damage stat and HP, perhaps unlock another player option.
